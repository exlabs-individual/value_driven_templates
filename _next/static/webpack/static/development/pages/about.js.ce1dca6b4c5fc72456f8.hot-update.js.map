Yet many IT teams suffer from lack of true alignment with business goals, which results in software becoming a cost generator instead of an assets.

It’s not longer possible to measure business benefit simply by direct ROI from implemented change. \n        Your enterprise’s software ecosystem is most likely very complex and you need a great roadmap to navigate it.
