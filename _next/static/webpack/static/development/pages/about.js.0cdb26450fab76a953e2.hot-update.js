Yet many IT teams suffer from lack of true alignment with business goals, which results in software becoming a cost generator instead of an assets. There\u2019s now a handful number of resources and tools helping engineers improve software delivery performance, though most of them don\u2019t fill the gap when it comes to match IT strategy with delivery.",

That\u2019s why we\u2019ve came up with a concept of Value Driven Engineering which manifests a need to focus on results rather than actions. In days of ubiquitous dependency on software, results are more multi-dimensional than ever before. It\u2019s not longer possible to measure business benefit simply by direct ROI from implemented change.  Your enterprise\u2019s software ecosystem is most likely very complex and you need a great roadmap to navigate it. In order to help organisations reduce  waste and guess work, we\u2019ve created a curated list of resources and frameworks we use in our day-to-day practice.",
