Yet many IT teams\n          suffer from lack of true alignment with business goals, which results\n          in software becoming a cost generator instead of an assets. There’s\n          now a handful number of resources and tools helping engineers improve\n          software delivery performance, though most of them don’t fill the gap\n          when it comes to match IT strategy with delivery.\n        </Section>\n        <Section textPosition=\"left\" title=\"Our values\" image=\"values\">\n          At Exlabs, we believe that the true alignment between management and\n          engineers can only be achieved by helping both sides speak the same\n          language. That’s why we’ve came up with a concept of Value Driven\n          Engineering which manifests a need to focus on results rather than\n          actions. In days of ubiquitous dependency on software, results are\n          more multi-dimensional than ever before. It’s not longer possible to\n          measure business benefit simply by direct ROI from implemented change.\n          Your enterprise’s software ecosystem is most likely very complex and\n          you need a great roadmap to navigate it. In order to help\n          organisations reduce waste and guess work, we’ve created a curated\n          list of resources and frameworks we use in our day-to-day practice.\n        </Section>\n\n        <Section textPosition=\"right\" title=\"Sharing\" image=\"sharing\">\n          \"We believe the knowledge we share here will help IT groups improve\n          their planning, delivery and maintenance processes, which would result\n          in delivering software assets better suited for unique business\n          needs.\"\n          <ContributionText>\n            Interested in contribute?\n            <Link\n              href={`${process.env.ASSET_PREFIX}${AppRoute.HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE}`}\n            >\n              <a\n                href={`${process.env.ASSET_PREFIX}${AppRoute.HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE}`}\n              >\n                Learn more here.\n              </a>\n            </Link>\n          </ContributionText>\n        </Section>\n      </StyledAbout>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n","import React from 'react';\nimport AnchorLink from 'react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll';\nimport {\n  StyledHeader,\n  InformationContainer,\n  HeaderTitle,\n  HeaderSubtitle,\n  HeaderImage,\n} from './about-header.styles';\nimport { SpecialLink } from '../../../ui/special-link/special-link.component';\n\nexport const AboutHeader = () => {\n  return (\n    <StyledHeader>\n      <InformationContainer>\n        <HeaderTitle>Hello, We are Exlabs.</HeaderTitle>\n        <HeaderSubtitle>\n          We deliver high-level consultancy & flexible, complex data-driven\n          software solutions for the companies of the future.\n        </HeaderSubtitle>\n        <AnchorLink\n          offset=\"100\"\n          href=\"#articles\"\n          style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}\n        >\n          <SpecialLink\n            href=\"#about-content\"\n            label=\"Read about Value Driven Engineering\"\n          />\n        </AnchorLink>\n      </InformationContainer>\n      <HeaderImage src=\"/about/header.svg\" alt=\"About header\" />\n    </StyledHeader>\n  );\n};\n","import styled from 'styled-components';\n\nexport const StyledHeader = styled.header``;\n\nexport const InformationContainer = styled.section``;\n\nexport const HeaderTitle = styled.h2``;\n\nexport const HeaderSubtitle = styled.h3``;\n\nexport const HeaderImage = styled.img``;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAcA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACxDA;AACA;AACA;AAOA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;;;;;;;;;;;;AClCA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
