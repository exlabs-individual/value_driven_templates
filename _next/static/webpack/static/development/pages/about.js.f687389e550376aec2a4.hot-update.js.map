Yet many IT teams suffer from\n        lack of true alignment with business goals, which results in software\n        becoming a cost generator instead of an assets. There’s now a handful\n        number of resources and tools helping engineers improve software\n        delivery performance, though most of them don’t fill the gap when it\n        comes to match IT strategy with delivery.\n      </Section>\n      <Section textPosition=\"left\" title=\"Our values\" image=\"values\">\n        At Exlabs, we believe that the true alignment between management and\n        engineers can only be achieved by helping both sides speak the same\n        language. That’s why we’ve came up with a concept of Value Driven\n        Engineering which manifests a need to focus on results rather than\n        actions. In days of ubiquitous dependency on software, results are more\n        multi-dimensional than ever before. It’s not longer possible to measure\n        business benefit simply by direct ROI from implemented change. Your\n        enterprise’s software ecosystem is most likely very complex and you need\n        a great roadmap to navigate it. In order to help organisations reduce\n        waste and guess work, we’ve created a curated list of resources and\n        frameworks we use in our day-to-day practice.\n      </Section>\n\n      <Section textPosition=\"right\" title=\"Sharing\" image=\"sharing\">\n        \"We believe the knowledge we share here will help IT groups improve\n        their planning, delivery and maintenance processes, which would result\n        in delivering software assets better suited for unique business needs.\"\n        <ContributionText>\n          Interested in contribute?
